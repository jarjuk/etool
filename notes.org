** Latex snippet

  From the geometry 

  \[ tan( \alpha/2 ) =   \frac{cut/2}{ h + z }  \], 

  where is $h$ can be calculated using tip width $w$ and tip angle
  $\alpha$

  \[ tan(\alpha/2) = \frac{w/2}{h}  \Leftrightarrow h = \frac{w}{2tan(\alpha/2)}\]

  Hence, 

  \[  cut = 2 tan(\alpha/2)[ h + z] = 2 tan(\alpha/2) [  \frac{w}{2 tan(\alpha/2)}  + z ] \]
